Low-Cost micro-ohm measurement platform for conducting materials

  The idea behind this project is to implement a robust, low-cost platform to measure resistances of conductors which is an important step in the electromagnetic characterization of conducting materials, which aids in designing electrical machines. Most instrumentation to this end is both large and expensive and hence may not be accessible to most local colleges in India due to a lack of funds and resources, which is a problem we aim to solve with this project.

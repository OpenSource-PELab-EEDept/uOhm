Low-Cost micro-ohm measurement platform for conducting materials

  The idea behind this project is to implement a robust, low-cost platform to measure resistances of conductors which is an important step in the electromagnetic characterization of conducting materials, which aids in designing electrical machines. Most instrumentation to this end is both large and expensive and hence may not be accessible to most local colleges in India due to a lack of funds and resources, which is a problem we aim to solve with this project.

All components selected for this project are commercially available on Indian websites (robu.in, sunrom.com, probots.co.in, etc). Product links mentioned in the parts list are merely suggestions and subject to availability. None of the contributors to this project are associated to any such website and neither intend to promote the former, nor earn any commission from any sales generated from the links.

All the 3D models generated (for the platform and casing) have been generated using FreeCAD, an Open-Source CAD program.
The Schematic and PCB layout has been generated on EasyEDA, an Open-Source Circuit Design suite.

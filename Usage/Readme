This folder contains instructions and tutorial material on how to properly use the system 

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -
After successfully assembling and programming the system - 
-Place the sample on the sping-loaded contact platform/grasp both ends of sample with crocodile clips
-Place jumpers on desired gain levels and corresponding gain selector pins
-Turn the potentiometer screw to change current passing through sample
-Place probes on sample with probe terminals apart by a known distance 'd' apart
-Take multiple readings for resistance value

-To find resistivity of material, use the formula - œÅ = RA/d,
where R = Resistance measured between two probe terminals
      A = Cross-sectional area of the sample
      d = distance between probe terminals

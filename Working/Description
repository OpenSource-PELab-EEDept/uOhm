The device works on the basic principle of Ohm's law, i.e. V = IR to measure resistances
An OP-AMP controlled MOSFET drives a large current (upto 1.5A) through the sample
This current gives rise to a voltage drop as it passes through the sample. This voltage drop is very small due to the high conductivity of the sample (intended application)
This voltage drop is then amplified by the instrumentation amplifier and fed to the Arduino's internal ADC
Current is measured by a Hall-effect based current sensing module, which outputs an analog voltage that is fed to the Arduino's internal ADC
The Resistance, Current and Voltage values are then calculated using the values fed to the ADC and displayed on the OLED display
